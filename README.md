# KsHook
Ksike Hook library for easy implementation of Event Driven Design. The Hooks pattern is a design pattern that facilitates event-driven programming within a software architecture. It allows you to define events and configure them with subscribers and notifiers. Subscribers listen to specific events and define which notifier should handle them when the event is triggered. This pattern enhances modularity and extensibility in event-driven systems.
